Hello World Tutorial
I am from Park Ridge, Illinois originally but now am from NYC. I prefer Chicago-area better though. I was in Dunne Hall but now live off-campus and am stuck here in quarantine! I am president of the Sports Analytics Club and was on the board for Bookstore Basketball, so I'm sad it wasn't able to play out this year :(
